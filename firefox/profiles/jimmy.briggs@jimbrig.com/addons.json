Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":2894,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/174/174500.png?modified=1622132161","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174500.jpg?modified=1622132161","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.21,"reviewCount":887,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1615201695000},{"id":"simple-translate@sienori","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/857/857110-32.png?modified=260ce8c8","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/857/857110-64.png?modified=260ce8c8","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/857/857110-128.png?modified=260ce8c8"},"name":"Simple Translate","version":"2.6.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3832892/simple_translate-2.6.1-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://simple-translate.sienori.com","supportURL":"https://github.com/sienori/simple-translate","description":"Quickly translate selected text on web page.

This library is also used for the Firefox Reader View and it simplifies the page so that only the important parts are clipped. (Licensed under Apache License Version 2.0)\n- Turndown by Dom Christie in version 7.0.1 is used to convert the simplified HTML (from Readability.js) into markdown. (Licensed under MIT License)\n- Moment.js version 2.27.0 used to format dates in template variables\n\nPermissions\n- Data on all sites: used to enable \"Download All Tabs\" functionality - no other data is captured or sent online\n- Access tabs: used to access the website content when the icon in the browser bar is clicked.\n- Manage Downloads: necessary to be able to download the markdown file.\n- Storage: used to save extension options\n- Clipboard: used to copy Markdown to clipboard\n\nPricing\nHuh?
