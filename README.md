## About

- The dotfiles are intended for use on a Windows machine running either Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro.
- The dotfiles also include WSL specific configurations and setups.
- Dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://github.com/jimbrig/dotfiles-wsl/blob/main) and various tweaks I have created to keep home directory as lean as possible.
